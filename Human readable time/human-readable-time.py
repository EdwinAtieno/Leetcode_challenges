Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

    HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
    MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
    SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.

In Python, the :02d is a string formatting specifier used with the format() method or f-strings to control how numbers
are displayed. It is commonly used for formatting integers, ensuring that they have a minimum width of two characters,
and are zero-padded on the left if necessary.
