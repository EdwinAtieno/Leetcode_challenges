## About the Repository

Each subfolder in this repository corresponds to a particular problem on LeetCode. The folder name consists of the problem number and the problem name, separated by an underscore.

Within each folder, you will find a solution file (usually in Python, Java or C++) and a README file that explains the problem and provides the solution's time and space complexity.

All solutions are thoroughly tested on the LeetCode platform and passed all test cases. However, if you find any errors or mistakes in the code or the explanation, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:\
    a. Using SSH:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:EdwinAtieno/Leetcode_challenges.git
   ```

   b. Using Http:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EdwinAtieno/Leetcode_challenges.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned folder:

   ```
   cd Leetcode_challenges
   ```

3. In order to create a virtual environment, run:

   ```
   pipenv shell
   ```

   - It will also create Pipfile and Pipfile.lock for package requirements.

4. So as to install the packages in your environment, run:

   ```
   pipenv install
   ```

   - In order to install all packages(including dev packages), run:
     ```
     pipenv install --dev
     ```

5. To install the pre-commit git hooks, run:

   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```


## How to Use the Repository

To use this repository, simply clone or download it onto your local machine. You can then browse through the various folders to find problems that interest you.

Each problem folder contains a README file that provides a detailed explanation of the problem and its constraints, as well as a solution file that demonstrates an effective approach to solving the problem.

You can run the solution file locally to verify the correctness of the solution, and then submit it to the LeetCode platform to see how it performs against other solutions.
